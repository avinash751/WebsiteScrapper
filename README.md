# C# Website Scraper

This project is a C# Windows Forms application designed to scrape content from documentation websites and save it as Markdown files.

## Conversation Summary

We started with a request for a console application, then pivoted to a Windows Forms application for a better user experience.

**Key Decisions & Fixes:**
*   **Project Setup:** Created a Windows Forms project and added `HtmlAgilityPack` and `ReverseMarkdown` NuGet packages.
*   **UI Design:** Implemented a basic UI with URL input, file path selection, start button, progress bar, and status label.
*   **Initial Scraping Logic:** Implemented a `Scraper` class with `HttpClient` for fetching HTML and `ReverseMarkdown` for conversion.
*   **Error Handling & Progress:** Added `try-catch` blocks and `IProgress` for UI updates.
*   **UI Labels & Save Dialog:** Added descriptive labels to UI elements and configured the `SaveFileDialog` to default to `.txt` files.
*   **Anchor Link Handling:** Implemented logic to ignore anchor links that point to the same page.

**Issues Encountered & Addressed (with varying success):**
*   **File Access Issues:** Persistent problems reading and writing `Form1.cs` using `read_file`, `read_many_files`, and `replace` tools, despite `glob` successfully finding the file. This has been a recurring and frustrating issue.
*   **0-Kilobyte File Output:** Initially, the output file was 0 KB, indicating no content was being scraped. This was traced to an overly restrictive content extraction XPath.
*   **Incomplete Recursive Scraping:** The scraper was not fully traversing all nested links within the target domain. This was due to an incorrect `_baseUrl` comparison.
*   **Duplicate Scraping/Looping:** The scraper was getting stuck in loops or scraping the same content multiple times due to issues with `_visitedLinks` management and URL normalization.

## Current Problem & Task

The application is currently experiencing a regression where it only scrapes the first file and no text is being scraped. The output file is 0 KB, indicating a complete failure in content extraction.

**Specific Issues:**
*   **Recursive Scraping Failure:** The scraper is not following links to nested pages within the same domain.
*   **Content Extraction Failure:** The content extraction logic is not robust enough to consistently find the main content on all pages, resulting in 0 KB output files.
*   **File Access Persistence:** The persistent issues with accessing and modifying `Form1.cs` using the provided tools are severely hindering development.

**Current Task:**
1.  **Fix Recursive Scraping:** Re-evaluate and fix the link traversal logic to ensure all valid, same-domain links are followed exactly once. This involves:
    *   Correctly initializing `_baseHost` to only the domain of the initial URL.
    *   Using a `Queue` (`_linksToScrape`) to manage URLs to visit and a `HashSet` (`_visitedLinks`) to track visited URLs (normalized to remove fragments and trailing slashes).
    *   Ensuring the comparison `absoluteUri.Host != _baseHost` is accurate.
2.  **Improve Content Extraction Robustness:** Implement a more flexible content extraction strategy that can reliably find the main content on diverse documentation pages. This involves:
    *   Prioritizing semantic HTML tags (`<main>`, `<article>`).
    *   Falling back to common `div` IDs (`main-content`, `content`, `page-content`, `wrapper`, `container`).
    *   Falling back to common `div` classes (`main-content`, `content`, `page-content`, `wrapper`, `container`, `doc-content`).
    *   As a last resort, attempting to find the largest `div` in the `body` while excluding known non-content elements (e.g., navigation, headers, footers, sidebars).

## Important Details for Next Chat

*   **File Access Challenges:** The primary blocker has been the inability to consistently `read_file` or `read_many_files` for `Form1.cs`, and `replace` sometimes failing with the same error, despite `glob` successfully identifying the file.
    *   **Absolute Path:** We are consistently using the absolute path: `C:\Users\avinash\Desktop\WebsiteScrapper\WebsiteScraperUI\Form1.cs`.
    *   **Error Message:** The recurring error is "File path must be within one of the workspace directories: C:\Users\avinash\Desktop\WebsiteScrapper". This is confusing as the path *is* within the workspace.
*   **Current `Scraper` Class State:**
    *   Uses `_baseHost` for domain comparison.
    *   Uses `_visitedLinks` (HashSet) and `_linksToScrape` (Queue) for managing traversal.
    *   Includes a `NormalizeUrl` helper method.
    *   Content extraction logic is currently the expanded version with multiple fallbacks.

We need to resolve the file access issue to effectively debug and implement the remaining fixes.
